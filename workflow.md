## Architecture

### Shared Styles
- **`styles.css`** — Single shared stylesheet containing CSS variables, reset, nav, layout, typography, impact sections, throughline, video/work items, contact bar, responsive breakpoints
- Each page links `styles.css` and uses a small inline `<style>` block for page-specific overrides only
- **Exception:** `experiential-knowledge.html` has its own complete dark-theme `<style>` block (different fonts, colors, variables) that overrides `styles.css`

### Navigation
- **Index page:** Static chapter list in hero right column; hamburger nav slides in on scroll past hero
- **Inner pages (theater, agency, interactive, ai-systems):** Hamburger menu (☰) with semi-transparent plum overlay, current page highlighted
- **experiential-knowledge.html:** Has its own dark-theme nav — do not modify

### Page Layout Pattern (inner pages)
- Page header with category label, title (left), and tagline (right) in a 2-column grid
- Two-column content area (sticky left, scrollable right)
- Impact/stats section with optional "Featured In" press row
- Throughline + "Next" link

### Index Page Layout
- Hero: name + gradient differentiator (left), chapter navigation (right), bouncing chevron scroll hint
- Timeline: alternating left/right entries (2007–2026) with milestone markers, staggered fade-in animations
- Skills block: hover-to-plum skill tags
- Contact bar

### Fonts
- **Light theme (all pages except experiential-knowledge):** Plus Jakarta Sans (200–800)
- **Dark theme (experiential-knowledge only):** Cormorant Garamond (serif) + DM Sans (sans)

### Color System
- **Light theme:** Background `#FAFAF8`, text `#1a1a1a`, accent plum `#5A2650`
- **Dark theme (experiential-knowledge):** Background `#070707`, text `#e8e4df`, accents gold `#c9a96e` + blue `#7a9bb5`
- **Key styling patterns:** Client names in plum, tagline `<em>` bold+italic+plum, section headers bold plum

## Development Checklist

### Still To Do
- [ ] Add `<meta name="description">` tags to each page for SEO
- [ ] Add Open Graph / social meta tags
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Audit accessibility (alt text on logos, ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- [ ] Test all inter-page navigation links
- [ ] Test responsive layouts on mobile / tablet breakpoints
- [ ] Verify contact email link on index.html works
- [ ] Add responsive handling for page-header tagline grids (mobile stacking)
- [ ] Add responsive handling for timeline on mobile

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize Google Fonts loading (preconnect, font-display)
- [ ] Consider self-hosting Plus Jakarta Sans
- [ ] Optimize logo image sizes (some are large originals)

## Notes

- **experiential-knowledge.html** has its own design system — dark theme, different fonts, different color palette. Never modify its styling from shared CSS work.
- Page 5 has scroll-triggered reveal animations (JavaScript at bottom of file).
- Index page has scroll-triggered nav (JavaScript at bottom of file).
- Site is fully static — no server, no framework, no dependencies beyond Google Fonts.
- `site-copy.md` contains all visible text from all pages (except experiential-knowledge) for content review.
